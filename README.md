Salary Prediction using Ensemble Learning is a machine learning project focused on accurately estimating the salary of an individual based on multiple features such as education, experience, job role, industry, and location. The project leverages the power of ensemble learning techniques to build robust regression models that outperform traditional single-algorithm approaches.

The goal is to assist employers, HR teams, and job-seekers in understanding expected salary ranges, making compensation planning more data-driven and transparent.
